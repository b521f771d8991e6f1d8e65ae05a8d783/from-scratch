 - macOS/Darwin: in nix, outside of nix
 - Devcontainer: using debian
 - locally via the Makefile

## Artifacts:
 - Android App, via the Makefile (make android-apk), distribute via Google Play and F-Droid
 - iOS/macOS App, built via the Makefile (make ios-ipa macos), distribute via the Mac App store
 - Windows App: TPD, distribute via the Windows App Store
 - WebUI, built either via:
  - Nix Flake
  - Docker Image
 - Linux Desktop App, built via Nix (copy with nix copy), or available in your distribution

# I do not need everything in there!!!
You are right. Strip out everything you do not need, and keep what you like. If you can throw away 99% of the stuff in this project and still find something useful, I am okay with that.
