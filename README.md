# from-scratch
A simple, very opinionated template for all sorts of AI projects!

## How to Develop?
| Platform / Environment | Notes |
|------------------------|-------|
| macOS / Darwin 🍎 |  Choose either the traditional Makefile workflow or the reproducible Nix ❄️ build system. |
| Windows / Linux / macOS |  Use the Devcontainer the container provides a consistent Debian environment for development. |

## How to get Artifacts?
| Platform 🌐 | Build Method | Distribution Channel |
|------------|--------------|----------------------|
| **Android** 📱 | `make android‑apk` (Makefile) | **Google Play™**, F‑Droid |
| **iOS / macOS** 🍎 | Nix Flake ❄️ **or** `make ios‑ipa` / `make macos-dmg` (Makefile) | **Apple App Store™** |
| **Windows** 🪟 | TPD | TBD |
| **WebUI** 🌍 | `nix run` ❄️ **or** Docker Image 🐋 | Docker Container |
| **Linux Desktop** 🐧 | Nix (`nix copy` / `nix run`) **or** binary builds for your distro | `nix run` ❄️ **or** Distribution’s package manager |

# I do not need everything in there!!!
You are right. Strip out everything you do not need, and keep what you like. If you can throw away 99% of the stuff in this project and still find something useful, I am okay with that.
