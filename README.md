# from-scratch
A simple, very opinionated template for all sorts of AI projects!

## How to Develop?
| Platform / Environment | Notes |
|------------------------|-------|
| **macOS / Darwin** 🍎 |  Choose either the traditional Makefile workflow or the reproducible Nix build system. |
| Linux 🐧 | Use nix or, if you have set up your system correctly, the Makefile (not recommended) |
| Windows / Linux / macOS |  Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux; the container provides a consistent Debian environment for development. |

## How to get Artifacts?
| Platform 🌐 | Build Method | Distribution Channel |
|------------|--------------|----------------------|
| **Android** 📱 | `make android‑apk` (Makefile) | **Google Play™**, F‑Droid |
| **iOS / macOS** 🍎 | Nix Flake ❄️ **or** `make ios‑ipa` / `make macos` (Makefile) | **Apple App Store™** |
| **Windows** 🪟 | TPD (Target Platform Deployment) | Windows App Store |
| **WebUI** 🌍 | Nix Flake ❄️ **or** Docker Image 🐋 | Docker Container |
| **Linux Desktop** 🐧 | Nix (`nix copy` / `nix run`) **or** binary builds for your distro | Distribution’s package manager |

# I do not need everything in there!!!
You are right. Strip out everything you do not need, and keep what you like. If you can throw away 99% of the stuff in this project and still find something useful, I am okay with that.
